# Database Exports

You can find recent exports of the Ubi Erat Lupa database in this repository.

- `lupa.sql`: This file contains a full database dump. You need to load it into a PostgreSQL database to work with it.
- `monuments.csv`: This is a CSV file with all stone monuments in the lupa database. Use this if you want to work with Excel or similar programs.

If you need more recent exports, or exports in a different format, please contact jakob@eggerapps.at
